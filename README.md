# EDA-on-Startup-Acquistion-Status-Modeling-on-Crunchbase-Data
Exploratory Data Analysis
This project is part of my internship at Technocolabs, where I performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) on startup acquisition status using Crunchbase data. The goal of the project was to identify trends and patterns in the data, and build a predictive model to determine whether a startup is likely to be acquired.

## Tasks
The following tasks were completed as part of this project:

1. A heatmap to visualize missing values.
2. Percentage of missing values.
3. Drop missing values - columns.
4. Drop missing values - rows.
4. Parsing dates.
5. Checking status of the companies using bar graph.
6. Companies services using bar graph.
7. Correlation between the features using heatmap.
8. Target encoding.
9. Features clustering

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to have Python 3 and the following packages installed:

* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* scikit-learn

You can install these packages using pip:


```Python
pip install pandas 
pip install matplotlib 
pip install seaborn 
pip install scikit-learn
```
## Usage
To use this project, you can download or clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash 
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/EDA-on-Startup-Acquistion-Status-Modeling-on-Crunchbase-Data.git
```
## Data
The data used in this project was obtained from Crunchbase, a platform for discovering business information about private and public companies. The dataset contains information on various startups, including their acquisition status, funding, and services provided.

# Conclusion
This project highlights the importance of EDA in identifying trends and patterns in data, and how these insights can be used to build predictive models. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in data analysis and modeling techniques, which will be valuable in future data science projects.

# Acknowledgements
I would like to thank Technocolabs for providing me with the opportunity to work on this project, as well as Crunchbase for providing the data used in this project.
